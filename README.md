# Maze Generator Demo by TChapman500
This project was inspired by this video from CaptainLuma:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbXKcDVV4G0

This program will generate a maze from scratch using either the Origin Shift algorithm invented by
CaptainLuma, or using the Depth First Search algorithm.  It will then use CaptainLuma's Origin
Shift algorithm to modify the maze.  The maze generated will always be a perfect maze and will
remain a perfect maze every time it is modified.

You can download the program from here:
